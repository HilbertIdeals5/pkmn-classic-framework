        Pok&eacute; Classic Network is an unofficial replacement for the original Generation IV and V online services, re-enabling the GTS, Battle Videos, and more. It works with Wiimmfi for general-purpose NWFC emulation, and Kaeru WFC for SSL offloading. (Compatibility with AltWFC servers is not guaranteed.)<br><br>
        <span class="heading">HOW TO CONNECT:</span><br>
        To properly connect to this service, you need to change the DNS addresses for your connection to the ones below.<br><br>
        Primary DNS:<br><span class="dns">178.&emsp;62.&emsp;43.212</span><br>
        Secondary DNS:<br><span class="dns">&emsp;&emsp;0.&emsp;&emsp;0.&emsp;&emsp;0.&emsp;&emsp;0</span><br><br>
        You can access these settings by going to the "Nintendo WFC Settings" in your game's main menu, tapping the big blue "Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Settings" button, then tapping on the connection you're using, and scrolling to the bottom.<br><br>
        Set "Auto-obtain DNS" to "No", then edit the "Primary DNS" and "Secondary DNS", and tap "Save Settings".

            Concept for the feature list box:
            Visitors can select the generation they're using to find out which services can be used in their game's generation. This can serve multiple purposes:
            - Lets visitors know the full extent of their games' online capabilities (since the games don't lay this information out in one place)
            - Can be used to indicate feature progress; in other words, letting users know whether the feature is working or not
            - Can be used to provide links to information pages on how to use the service (since the games only offer vague text explanations)
            - It's also nice as just a cool decoration

    The service supports battles over WFC, but is there easily-accessible data for how many battles are taking place at once?
    The reason why I'm asking: In an image I found here (https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pokémon_Global_Link), the 2012 Global Link screenshot, I noticed a "VS". I figured that it would be good to have something aside from trades to fill the globe.
